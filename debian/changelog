  [ JosephMcc ]
  * Recolor the tooltips in all theme variations
  * gtk3: Clean up linked button borders Fix several small issues. Also quit using the selected_bg_color for active buttons since it gives the visual appearance of the active button being larger than its neighbors.

  * Fix an error in the previous commit that left active linked buttons with the wrong border color
  * build-themes.py: Make sure we update all the needed assets when generating the themes. Not just the gtk3 assets
  * cinnamon: Make some general improvements to the cinnamon themes
  * Cinnamon: Use the same theming for panel launchers regardless of whether they are located on the top or bottom panel.
